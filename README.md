# Dual-Active-Bridge-Converter-DAB-
MATLAB/Simulink models for a Dual Active Bridge (DAB) DC-DC converter with solar PV integration. Includes standalone DAB configurations, variable load conditions, and test cases for analyzing converter performance in renewable energy applications and EV charging. 
# Single Phase Shift Modulation Technique

The primary and secondary voltage phase difference determines the power flow between the primary and secondary side of the transformer.
